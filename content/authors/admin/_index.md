I am a graduate student in computer science master student at [Eberhard-Karls-University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen focusing on *Artificial Intelligence*. Before that, I studied computer science in a dual setup at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/home/) in Stuttgart which involved frequent and extended industry research and development projects on topics regarding *Manufacturing Execution Systems*. The particular topics included work on *Single Product Tracking*, _Improvement on Data Analysis_ as well as _Key Performance Indicators_. During that time I've also worked with [Olaf Herden](https://expertenservice.dhbw-stuttgart.de/experteninnen-technik/informatik/olaf-herden/) on NewSQL databases.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

During my masters degree I attended research internships such as the [Extreme Blue internship](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/) at IBM, where I’ve researched the _Connection between Internet of Things and Master Data Management_. Also, I presented the obtained results at a conference in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Currently I'm doing research on *Benchmarking Deep Learning Optimizers* with [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/personen/philipp-hennig/) and [Frank Schneider](https://fsschneider.netlify.com/).
