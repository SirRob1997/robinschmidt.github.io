I'm a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Apple where I work on Machine Translation. Previously, I've been a graduate student in computer science at the University of Tübingen working with the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF) in the group of [Zeynep Akata](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata) and co-supervised by [Massimiliano Mancini](https://eml-unitue.de/people/massimiliano-mancini). I've also been working on *Optimization* in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in the group of [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/personen/philipp-hennig/) where I was co-supervised by [Frank Schneider](https://fsschneider.netlify.com/). Before that, I've also been gaining experience as a software engineer, either as an [Extreme Blue intern](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/) at IBM or my three years at Eisenmann SE where we were developing a Manufacturing Execution System.
