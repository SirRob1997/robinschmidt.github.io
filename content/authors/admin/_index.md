I am a graduate student in computer science at [Eberhard-Karls-University](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen focusing on *Deep Learning* and currently working on *Explainable Domain Generalization* in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics (MPI-INF) in the group of [Zeynep Akata](https://eml-unitue.de/people/zeynep-akata) and co-supervised by [Massimiliano Mancini](https://eml-unitue.de/people/massimiliano-mancini). Previously, I've been working on *Deep Learning Optimizers* in cooperation with the Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in the group of [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/personen/philipp-hennig/) and co-supervised by [Frank Schneider](https://fsschneider.netlify.com/). I've also been an [Extreme Blue intern](https://www.ibm.com/employment/extremeblue/) at IBM working with [Martin Oberhofer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-oberhofer-9444382/).

For my bachelors, I studied computer science in a dual setup at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/home/) in Stuttgart which involved frequent and extended industry research and development projects on topics regarding *Manufacturing Execution Systems*. I've also done research with [Olaf Herden](https://expertenservice.dhbw-stuttgart.de/experteninnen-technik/informatik/olaf-herden/).
